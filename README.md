# Decentralised_iNotebook

"Decentralized_iNotebook is an innovative project at the intersection of blockchain technology and note-taking convenience. Leveraging the power of the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain, this project introduces a new paradigm for secure and immutable note storage.

At its core, Decentralized_iNotebook offers users a React frontend, which is not only user-friendly but also seamlessly integrated with the ICP blockchain. This means that every note you create or store using this platform benefits from the robust security and permanence of blockchain technology.
